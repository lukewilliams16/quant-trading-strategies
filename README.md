Quantitative Trading Strategies

This project showcases a series of quantitative trading strategies, built in stages, to identify high-probability trading opportunities based on technical indicators and market dynamics.

Project Structure
Level 1 – Momentum Riding and Dip Buying

The first level focuses on riding momentum in established trends, with entries triggered by short-term pullbacks ("dips"). The goal is to buy these dips and profit from the continuation of the trend.

Level 2 – Moving Average Crossover with RSI Confirmation

The second level introduces simple moving average (SMA) crossovers to identify trend changes, with RSI acting as a confirmation tool to reduce false signals during periods of low momentum.

Level 3 – Advanced Multi-Factor Enhancements

In this level, more advanced techniques are added, including exponential moving averages (EMA), first derivative analysis, and layered RSI filters. These adjustments aim to refine entry and exit points while minimizing risk.

Level 4 – Proprietary Multi-Dimensional Signal Optimization

This is the most advanced stage, utilizing higher-order derivatives and second-order momentum analysis to identify subtle shifts in market dynamics before they become apparent. The strategy incorporates adaptive, multi-layered filters to optimize entry and exit points based on real-time market conditions, providing a robust and flexible response to volatile market movements.
