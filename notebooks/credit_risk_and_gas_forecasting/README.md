# Credit Default & Gas Storage Analysis
This folder includes Python scripts for two separate financial analyses:

**[Credit Defualt Analysis]([/Credit_default_regression_and_binning.ipynb])**

Performs logistic regression to predict loan defaults using FICO scores and other factors. It calculates optimal FICO score bins with minimum data sizes and visualizes default rates by score ranges to better understand credit risk.

**[Gas Storage Contract Valuation](notebooks/Credit_default_regression_and_binning.ipynb)**
Calculates the net present value (NPV) of a gas storage contract based on injection and withdrawal schedules. It simulates daily storage levels, accounts for maximum capacity and monthly storage costs, and uses historical gas prices to value cash flows. This provides a realistic financial assessment of the contractâ€™s profitability.

Both scripts are designed for clarity and easy adaptation to similar datasets, aiding decision-making in lending risk and energy contract valuation.
